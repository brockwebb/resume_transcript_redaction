Changes ... move this to a docs folder later. I'm going to try and be more deciplined about capturing changes and decisions. 
Why? It's too easy to make changes in a thread, forget to capture, wonder why we went down a path, sometimes we need to take a step back becasue it was a step in the wrong direction, etc... I've broken more things than I can to think about because the documentation and change path was not well documented. This is too easy to do with AI as the speed that you can move is so incredibly fast. 

Before you know it like the Talking Heads song -- you may ask yourself how did I get here?

Here's a summary for the change log:

## Detector Restoration Project: DATE_TIME Detection Enhancement

## Major Architectural Changes

### üèó Configuration-Driven Entity Detection
<architectural-decision type="configuration">
- Implemented dynamic entity type loading from routing configuration
- Removed hardcoded entity type mappings
- Enhanced flexibility in detector configuration
- Enabled centralized control of entity detection through routing files
</architectural-decision>

### üîç Validation Strategy Refinement
<architectural-decision type="validation">
- Centralized validation logic in ValidationCoordinator
- Implemented robust, configuration-driven validation patterns
- Added confidence boosting mechanism based on context and pattern matching
- Supported multiple detection strategies (Presidio, SpaCy) with unified validation
</architectural-decision>

## Key Modifications

1. SpaCy Detector Enhancements
   - Dynamic entity type loading
   - Flexible entity mapping
   - Improved date entity detection

2. Configuration Updates
   - Added DATE_TIME to primary entity types
   - Mapped SpaCy's DATE to DATE_TIME
   - Configured confidence thresholds

3. Validation Improvements
   - Enhanced regex patterns for date detection
   - Added context-aware confidence boosting
   - Supported multiple date format recognitions

## Impact
- Improved DATE_TIME detection across different document contexts
- More robust and flexible entity detection system
- Centralized configuration management
- Enhanced validation accuracy

## Lessons Learned
- Configuration-driven design increases system flexibility
- Centralized validation can handle complex detection scenarios
- Mapping between different NLP models requires careful configuration

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the changes?
