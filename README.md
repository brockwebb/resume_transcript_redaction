# Resume Redaction Pipeline using Presidio

This repository showcases a prototype application that detects and redacts sensitive information (PII) from PDF resumes using [Microsoft Presidio](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio). It demonstrates the following features:

- **Random sampling** of PDF resumes from a given dataset
- **Presidio-based** detection of personal data such as names, emails, phone numbers, etc.
- **True PDF redaction** via black rectangles over detected text
- **Summary statistics** detailing the amount of data processed and redacted

## Data Source

- The sample resume data is obtained from the [Kaggle Resume Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/resume-dataset).
- You will need to put them all in the `/data/resumes` diretory

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the redactor script**  
   ```bash
   python redactor_app.py
   ```
   This will take a random sample of PDFs from `/data/resumes`, copy them into `/data/redaction_test`, and create redacted PDFs alongside the originals.

3. **Check outputs**  
   - Original files: `*_input.pdf`  
   - Redacted files: `*_redacted.pdf`  
   - Summary statistics printed to the console.
