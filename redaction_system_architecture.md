# Resume Redaction System Architecture

## Overview
The Resume Redaction System is designed to automatically detect and redact sensitive information from resumes and professional documents while preserving important technical and professional content. The system leverages both Presidio and spaCy for entity detection, using each tool's strengths while coordinating their outputs for optimal accuracy.

## System Components

### 1. Core Detection Framework
The system uses a modular entity detection framework with three main components:

#### BaseDetector Interface
Common interface for all detection implementations:
```python
class BaseDetector:
    """Base interface for entity detection implementations"""
    def detect_entities(self, text: str) -> List[Entity]
    def validate_detection(self, entity: Entity) -> bool
    def get_confidence(self, entity: Entity) -> float
```

#### Specialized Detectors

**PresidioDetector**
- Primary responsibility: Pattern-based and structured data detection
- Strengths:
  * Emails, phone numbers, credit cards
  * Social security numbers, ID numbers
  * Formatted dates and times
  * URLs and IP addresses

**SpacyDetector**
- Primary responsibility: Context-aware named entity recognition
- Strengths:
  * Person names and titles
  * Organization names
  * Geographic locations
  * Professional context understanding

#### EnsembleCoordinator
Manages the coordination between detectors:
- Routes entities to appropriate detector based on type
- Combines and validates results
- Resolves conflicts between detections
- Applies confidence thresholds

### 2. Configuration System

#### Entity Routing Configuration
New configuration file: `entity_routing.yaml`
```yaml
routing:
  presidio_primary:
    entities:
      - EMAIL
      - PHONE_NUMBER
      - SSN
      - CREDIT_CARD
      - URL
    confidence_threshold: 0.85

  spacy_primary:
    entities:
      - PERSON
      - ORG
      - GPE
    confidence_threshold: 0.75

  ensemble_required:
    entities:
      - TITLE
      - EDUCATION
      - ORGANIZATION
    confidence_thresholds:
      minimum_combined: 0.80
      minimum_individual: 0.60

validation_rules:
  context_window: 50  # words
  minimum_context_matches: 1
```

#### Detection Patterns Configuration
Enhanced `detection_patterns.yaml`:
- Pattern definitions for each entity type
- Context rules for validation
- Entity-specific confidence thresholds
- Technical term definitions and rules

### 3. Processing Pipeline

1. **Input Processing**
   - Document loading and text extraction
   - Initial text normalization
   - Batch management for multiple files

2. **Entity Detection**
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       A[Input Text] --> B[Entity Classification]
       B --> C{Route by Type}
       C -->|Pattern Match| D[Presidio Detector]
       C -->|Named Entity| E[spaCy Detector]
       C -->|Complex Entity| F[Ensemble Detection]
       D --> G[Result Aggregation]
       E --> G
       F --> G
       G --> H[Output Generation]
   ```

3. **Result Processing**
   - Confidence score calculation
   - Overlap resolution
   - Final validation checks
   - Redaction application

### 4. Supporting Infrastructure

#### Logging System
- Comprehensive error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Decision audit trails
- Debug information for each detection

#### Configuration Management
- Runtime configuration loading
- Environment-specific settings
- Pattern and rule management
- Dynamic updates support
